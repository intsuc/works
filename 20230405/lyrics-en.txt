A/A â§¸ Kotonoha Akane & Kotonoha Aoi

From a casual, whimsical,
Monologue,
Unknown worlds are born,
Let's go and see for ourselves

If the universe where you are were,
Monochrome,
We'll dye the words you spun,
With the two colors

We'll send our voice,
Casting magic,
At faster-than-light speed,
Carrying our love

If the universe where you are were,
Monotonous,
The days you spend are colored,
By the myriad of stars

We'll give our voice,
Not through magic,
By A/A,
With all our hearts

Small,
Hopes and,
Unseen,
Tomorrows
Spread out and,
Connect,
Like leaves of words

We'll send our voice,
Casting magic,
At faster-than-light speed,
Carrying our love

We'll give our voice,
Not through magic,
By A/A,
With all our hearts

We'll send our voice

We'll give our voice
